    "description": "The motor current output has exceeded the controller's current limit, causing the controller to shut down to protect against overheating. This usually happens during long periods of climbing with maximum pedal assist turned on. To clear the error, stop riding and power off the bike. Let the bike cool down for 2 minutes to see if the error code disappears upon reboot. The motor or controller could be damaged, such as from a worn cable or poor connection, either part may need to be replaced. If the error code persists, ensure there is no damage or loose connections with the motor or the controller.",

Check the cable that connects the rear hub motor to the rest of the controller, and make sure it is firmly connected and free from grit or contaminants. This error might appear if you don't reconnect the motor cable after removing the rear wheel (for example, after changing a flat tire.) At least one of the motor phase wires has been damaged or  disconnected. If checking the connection doesn't resolve the error, first replace the motor; and replace the controller if a new motor doesn't solve the issue.",

To resolve this, power off the bike, disconnect the rear hub motor connection, ensure it is clean, and then reconnect the connection fully. Power the bike on to clear the error code.

An E25 can be triggered if the brakes are held down while the bike is powered on. If the E25 error persists, this can generally be corrected by adjusting the sensitivity of the brake sensors.",

    "description": "The controller or motor has overheated from extended periods of extremely heavy use (for example, climbing a steep hill with maximum pedal assist applied), and has shut down to prevent damage. This occurs when the controller reaches 105 degrees Celsius. The bike may be getting pushed to its limits, causing the controller to become too hot. In some situations, removing extra weight from the bike and pedaling in a low gear/ PAS mode for long steep hills can prevent the bike from overheating. If the error code appears without engaging in strenuous cycling activities, a new controller may be needed.",

To remedy this issue, confirm that all of the cables are properly connected and that the proper battery and charger are in use. Use the display to view the real-time voltage being output from the battery to confirm it is correct. It can also be checked by an Aventon Dealer at the battery terminals using a volt meter.
